Welcome to Kiwi, a simple, easy to use, and fun Discord bot. Built using the discord.py library. Kiwi is currently in development, and is not yet ready for production use. I will be adding more features and proper documentation in the future.

### **Join our Kiwi server to try it out!**

### **Key Features**

* `confess`: confess your deepest, darkest secrets to Kiwi. Kiwi will keep your secrets safe, and will never tell anyone what you said. Kiwi will never judge you for what you tell her. Kiwi is a good listener, and will always be there for you.

    Type `kiwi confess` to start a confession. Your message will be erased, and Kiwi will send as a message anything you typed after the word `confess`.

Currently looking to add `react`, `game`, `math`, and `play` functions. Any aditional ideas would be greatly appreciated.

#

### **How to use**

<!-- If the bot starts getting any more complicated, steps for proper setup will be documented here -->

To use Kiwi, you must first add the bot to your server. You can do this by clicking [here](https://bit.ly/kiwi-bot). You must have the `Manage Server` permission to add Kiwi to your server.

### **List of commands**

* #### `confess`

*Yeah it is pretty lonely here. I am currently working on adding more commands. If you have any ideas, please let me know!
