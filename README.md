![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.4-%2300C875?color=%2300C875&style=for-the-badge)

Welcome to Kiwi, a simple, easy to use, and fun Discord bot. Built using the `discord.py` library. Kiwi is currently in development, and is not yet ready for production use. I will be adding more features and proper documentation in the future.

### **Join our Kiwi server to try it out!**

### **Key Features**

Tell Kiwi your deepest, darkest secrets with `confess`, ask the magic 8 ball with `magic`, and more! The `fun` commands are currently the most developed, and are the most fun (pun intended) to use.

Want to interact more with Kiwi? Try the `reaction` commands! Kiwi will react to your messages with a variety of different emojis.

Currently looking to add `react`, `game`, `math`, and `play` functions. If you have any ideas, please let me know!

### **How to use**

<!-- If the bot starts getting any more complicated, steps for proper setup will be documented here -->

To use Kiwi, you must first add the bot to your server. You can do this by clicking [here](https://bit.ly/kiwi-bot). You must have the `Manage Server` permission to add Kiwi to your server.
