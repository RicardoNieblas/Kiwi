Welcome to Kiwi, a simple, easy to use, and fun Discord bot. Built using the discord.py library. Kiwi is currently in development, and is not yet ready for production use. I will be adding more features in the future, and will be adding more documentation as well.

Currently looking to add `confess`, `react`, `game`, `math`, and `play` functions. Any aditional ideas would be greatly appreciated.
